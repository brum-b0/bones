                                                    <li> First, a brief introduction of the Apache configuration file. <img src='img/screenshots/ca_apache_config_files.png'></li>
                                                    <li>As we can see, there are several configuration files in the Apache folder. In the old versions of Apache, there is only one configuration file named “httpd.conf”. As for the latest version, the main configuration file is “apache2.conf”. We can take a quick look of this file.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_apache_conf.png'></li>
                                                    <li>There are many “include” commands in this file. This means the apache server will read this file first, and the other configuration files will be linked using these “include” commands.</li>
                                                    <li>As for the SSL configuration file, it is in the “sites-enabled” folder. We can use the following command to create a configuration file for SSL connection: <code>sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf</code></li> 
                                                    <li>Then we modify this default-ssl.conf as follows <img src='img/screenshots/ca_ssl_conf_file.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Here, 172.17.2.41 is the IP address of our web server. You can use the command “ifconfig” to check it out. The “443” is the port number for the SSL connection.</li>
                                                    <li>We temporarily named our server jhuws.edu. The digital certificate name is jhuws.crt, and the private key of the digital certificate name is jhuws.key. Of course you can make the name as you like, but make sure to use the same name later.</li>
                                                    <li>You should also use the following command to enable the SSL module of Apache2 if you receive a prompt  about a connection refusal while trying to connect port 443 to the web server: <code>sudo a2enmod ssl</code></li>
                                                    <li>Then, restart the apache2 service using the following commad: <code>sudo service apache2 restart</code></li>

                                                    <li>In this part we are going to generate a certificate sign request on the web server. First we need to SSH into the web server.</li>
                                                    <li>Then, we need to generate a private key for the web server: <code>sudo openssl genrsa -out jhuws.key 2048</code><img src='img/screenshots/ca_ws_ssl_key.png'></li>
                                                    <li> Now we need to configure the openssl.conf file just like we did previouls in the certificate authority node.</li>
                                                    <li>Next, we generate a certificate sign request for the web server: <code>sudo openssl req -new -key jhuws.key -out jhuws.csr</code>. When the prompt appears make sure to enter "jhuws.edu" for the common name, as pictured below. <img src='img/screenshots/ca_ws_cert_req.png'></li>

                                                    <li>In this step, the CA node needs to get the request sign document from the web server. We can use WinSCP or SFTP to send the jhuws.csr file from the ws node to the CA node. Before we send itn we need to  use the chmod command to allow access: <code>sudo chmod 777 jhuws.csr</code></li>
                                                    <li> Once the request sign document is on the CA node, we are going to sign it with the following command: <code>openssl  ca  -in  /etc/ssl/jhuws.csr  -out  /etc/ssl/jhuws.crt  -days  3650</code><img src='img/screenshots/ca_req_sign.png'><img src='img/screenshots/ca_req_sign2.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Then, we send this digital certificate back to the WS node. This can be done with WinSCP or SFTP.</li>
                                                    <li>Then, we use the next two commands to install the web server’s digital certificate. In other words, we should put the digital certificate file and key file into the correct folder of the web server.
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li><code>sudo cp jhuws.crt /etc/ssl/certs</code></li>
                                                            <li><code>sudo cp jhuws.key /etc/ssl/private</code></li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>Now, before we open the browser to see the result, we should copy the “cacert.pem” file from the CA node to the user node. We need to let the CA verify the digital certificate issued by CA, so we need this file on the web server. In addition, we should change the extension “.pem”to “.crt”.</li>

                                                    <li>Now, we can view the result of the work we have done. The following operations are all on the user node.</li>
                                                    <li>Because the display of the browser on GENI is kind of slow, we determine whether or not we are right by installing “curl” to perform a quick test. Curl is a tool that allows us to make HTTP requests from the command line.</li>
                                                    <li>Install curl by executing: <code>sudo apt-get isntall curl</code></li>
                                                    <li>Now we are going to make some modifications to our hosts file. The hosts file translates a website name to an IP address on the local machine before a DNS request is made to resolve teh website name. Change th privelages of the hosts file: <code>sudo chmod 777 hosts</code>. Now edit so that the IP adress of the ws node is set to the server name "jhuws.edu" like so.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_hosts_file.png'></li> 
                                                    <li> Now use curl to see if our webserver is working proparly: <code>curl jhuws.edu</code></li>
                                                    <li> The command should return the HTML of the apache server default page.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_curl_reg.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Now to test if the SSL configuration we modified ealier works, execute the following command: <code>curl https://jhuws.edu --cacert cacert.crt</code></li>
                                                    <li>Again the HTML of the Apache web server should appear. This means we have succesfully made an HTTP over SSL connection to our web server.</li>
                                                    <li>Now we are going to make the same HTTPS connection this time with our we browser. First, open firefox on the user node. Now we are going to install our digital certificate into the browser. Go to the preference option of the browser.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_firefox_pref.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Then, we go to Advanced and then to Certificates options. Click on “View Certificates”.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_firefox_adv_pref.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Then, import the cacert.crt file we put on the user node before.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_firefox_import_cert.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Now our certificate authority is in the list of certificate authorities.</li>
                                                    <li>We visit jhuws.edu/info.php first and see the connection is insecure.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_firefox_insecure.png'></li>
                                                    <li>Then we visit https://jhuws.edu/info.php and we can see a green lock, revealing that it is now a secure connection.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_firefox_secure.png'></li>
                                                    <li>We can view the details of this connection by clicking on the symbol “&gt;”.The information we put in when making the digital certificate is shown in this display. By now, we have already finished the experiment of building a certificate authority and issuing a digital certificate.<img src='img/screenshots/ca_firefox_digital_cert.png'></li>
