						<ul class='instructions'>
              <li> There is a spy in your midst! You have discovered that one of your colleagues is a spy but you do not know who it is... All you know is that they communicate with their handle through pictures that have a hidden message. In order to conceal their secret communication they have hidden a message in a picture. However, they are smart and cunning spies, thus they have multiple pictures that look the same, but only one picture has the message.</li>

					<div class='subcontent'>
            <ul>
              <li>Your mission is to scan all the files and find the picture that the handler is sending to the spy that is in our midst!</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <li>Begin by extracting the files from the provided archive which can also be found <a href="https://github.com/s-nat-e0/forensics/raw/master/movies.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
              <li><b>You can use the following linux commands</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>strings &lt;filename&gt;</code>, where you can substitute one of the picture file names that were in the archive.</li>
                  <li>Read the man page to figure out what the strings command does.</li>
                  <li>You are looking for a string that is unusually long.</li>
                  <li>Once you find that string you are done with the first hint of your forensics analysis.</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>The found string is a hash string.</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>What is a hash? A hash is an irreversible mathematical function that is commonly
used to "scramble", i.e., encrypt, passwords and store them securely. It is also
used to check the integrity of data. If a file has been tampered, its hash string will
be different than the original.</li>
                  <li>What is a hash string? A hash string is a result of a hash, it is really a set of
characters that correspond to the specific file or password and only that file or
password, none else!</li>
                  <li>You can generate hash strings using the linux command: <code>sha1sum &lt;filename&gt;</code>,
where you can substitute one of the picture file names that were in the archive.</li>
                  <li>Every file has a different hash string because it has been tampered with, even
though all files look that the same picture!</li>
                  <li>Only one hash corresponds to the file that has the secret that we are looking for.</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Download the picture in your desktop and open it with your favorite image processing tool</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The secret message is hidden somewhere in the picture</li>
                  <li>Only the very observative people with strong eyes can find it</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            </ol>
